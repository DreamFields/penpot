(ns app.loggers.audit.consumers.team-storage
  "The team-storage transport of the audit log consumer.

  It reads the stream from the team-storage cursor and marks dirty the
  teams whose media storage may have changed, so the recompute jobs of
  `app.tasks.team-storage` refresh the cached counter the
  media-storage-bytes-per-team quota reads.

  The component starts the consumer loop at boot when its flag is on. The
  mechanics (the tick mutex, the cursor, the frontier of the pass, the GC)
  live in `app.loggers.audit.consumers`."
